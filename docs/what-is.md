## What is EC2 ?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for active servers â€“ hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.

## What is VPC ? 
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a part of cloud computing service that provides a virtual private cloud, by provisioning a logically isolated section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

### Key Concepts of VPC
- **Virtual private cloud (VPC)** : A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
- **Subnet** : A range of IP addresses in your VPC
- **Route table** : A set of rules (aka routes), that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
- **Internet gateway** : A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.
- **VPC endpoint** : Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect connection.
- **CIDR block** : Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a way to represent an IP address and its network mask. 

## What is Security Group ?
A security group is a **virtual firewall** designed to protect AWS instances. It sits in front of designated instances and can be applied to **EC2**, **ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)** and **Amazon Relational Database Service**, among others. Security groups have distinctive rules for inbound and outbound traffic. The groups **allow all outbound traffic by default** and **deny any traffic not expressly allowed**. Security groups are also **stateful**, so all outbound traffic will be allowed back in. We can not block a specific IP address using security groups.


## What is Network Access Control List ? 
Network ACL (Access Control List) is a **virtual firewall for subnets**. It **allows** all the inbound or outbound IPv4 traffic and here we create a type of custom network all or each custom network ACL **denies** all inbound and outbound traffic. They are **stateless** and require you to clearly and properly define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic; otherwise, you might have connection issues within your environment. Network ACLs **cover entire subnets** and provide wide net protection that can encompass lots of resources at the same time. **In which all subnet in VPC must be combined with network ACL one subnet -one network ACL at a time.**
